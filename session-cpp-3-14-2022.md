# Arha - Intro to C++ L1
--

- Try to display when you're going to reconvene
	- Use notepad or something, or put it in your code, or intermission slide
- Try to draw things out more
- Don't forget to ask for questions
- Zoom in your repl.it so it's like ~18 font

--

- If you go over a vocab word, try to type it somewhere (code comment, etc)
- Try to connect to future lessons (ex: `iostream` in lesson 3, we'll learn more...)
- Might be helpful to give examples: such as header files to do complex math when we don't even have to, iostream isn't the most amazing example because everyone uses it

--

- Try to make more analogies, especially for the harder concepts
- Make sure you're relating concepts - you can think of scopes as namespaces but local within the program
- Make real-world connections (error codes, etc)
- Linker is kind of like a chrome extension: we have code that's extending a preexisting program

--
- Make sure you clearly define what people have to do since blocks of silence are really awkward
- Don't be afraid to touch on "real programming" uses of things (comments, etc.)
	- Sometimes ugly debugging tips are helpful
- I wouldn't use paint for things like binary, you can honestly write it in obsidian and have it live render ($10^1$, etc)
- Never use ðŸ™‚ ever again

# For Lesson 2
- Neil will have to show them the homepage link system once it's done (should be done by ~tonight)
- Arha taught a little bit about binary already, but go over it again
