# Neil - Intro to C++ L2
--

- Try to sound a little more lively, I know it's hard since you're tired but try 
- Between slides, try to explain a little bit more (remember that slides are only there to guide you, you should add more on top of it)
- Confirm what happens the previous lesson (look over prev lesson plan)
	- **If mentors do extra stuff, please try to update the lesson plan so whoever's teaching next can know (keep a "log")**
--
- Demonstrate stuff **all the time**
- When you type things into replit and you make a note, try to put it in a comment
- For example
```cpp
int i // Declaring (letting C++ know it exists)1
```
- Keep people engaged (say "we'll learn x next, you'll see this soon" to keep students interested
--
- You need a lot more examples in general - try to budget lots of time so you can go to repl.it and demonstrate literally everything
- **do not be afraid to go into memory! one of the biggest things that differentiates c++ from python is you get finer control over memory!**
- Remember - binary and bits are unfamiliar concepts, so make sure you remind them frequently
--
- Again don't forget not everyone is in the US if you're going to use examples like "license plate" make sure its specified
- Try to relate the vocab to everyday concepts: e. g. **initial**izing => initial value
- I like when you say something is wrong and offer a correct alternative-- keep doing that
