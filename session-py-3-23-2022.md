# Deepti - Intro to C++ L2

I like how you're relating things to students interests, keep doing that

Try to limit reading off the slides, you're getting better at it though

Again, for things like bools, link that to future lessons to keep up some suspense (keep them interested)

Asking questions on what the code will do - i like that

When you make a mistake, try to spend a little time going over it to make it more memorable so your students dont make the same mistake

Cut back on "basically", but you say it in a way that's not super offensive so I'm mostly fine with it

> Note for looking over slides, also for course developers: make sure all problem sets are numbered!
> 
> If they don't have numbers try to put the laser pointer or mouse over it

Again, if you say something, try to also type it out if you're able to so people can follow along easier

Overall, I think you're doing a good job given the older material you're working with
