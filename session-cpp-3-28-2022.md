# Intro to C++ L3 Neil

Try to sound less dead, I know you're tired but still, please try to talk a little more excitedly

Ask more rhetorical questions, they're a lot more interesting to listen to

Whenever you say something, try to write it out as well (in "class notes", can be on repl, etc)

I would not copy paste from slides into repl, try to retype it and explain wihle you're doing it

I see you're mapping c++ strange syntax (cin, cout) to vocab (in, out), keep doing that, it makes things less cryptic

Whenever you write code, even if it's a topic you already covered, explain what you're doing just in case someone missed, it, try to never code silently
