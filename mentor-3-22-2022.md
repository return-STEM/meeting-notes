# Lesson Material
- Handouts are more or less not a thing anymore
	- Intro to Python - still hand them out for now, but we plan to embed exercises into the guide

# Lesson Material

- I suggest you use something like [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/) for a "warm-up" posing the question ("what do you think of when you think of programming")
	- Since we usually start at 6:05 anyways, just let people do it as they come in
- Then go through the normal lesson flow
