# Guide

# Lesson Material
- Handouts are more or less not a thing anymore
	- Intro to Python - still hand them out for now, but we plan to embed exercises into the guide
- If you have missing stuff in your lesson plan, **make sure it's done**

Deepti, Ajay, Namit:
**1 and 2 lesson quiz done yet?**

---
# Lesson Material

- I suggest you use something like [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/) for a "warm-up" posing the question ("what do you think of when you think of programming")
	- Since we usually start at 6:05 anyways, just let people do it as they come in
- Then go through the normal lesson flow

---
# Recording
- Record the lesson with OBS
- Have your own mic and your desktop audio on two channels
- Person that's teaching should record
- settings> output> audio track
	- Check 1 and 2
- Advanced audio properties > check the tracks diagonally
- Record mkv, whole screen
- Make sure your audio doesn't clip
---
# Emails
